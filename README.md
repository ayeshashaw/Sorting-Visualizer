*Introduction*

The Sorting-Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to help users understand the inner workings of popular sorting algorithms. By providing a visual representation of the sorting process, this project makes it easier to grasp fundamental concepts in computer science and algorithm design. It’s an ideal educational resource for students, coding enthusiasts, and anyone curious about how sorting algorithms operate.

*Algorithm Selection*

Users can choose from four popular sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Quick Sort

Merge Sort

*Interactive Controls*

Generate New Array:

Allows users to create a new random array

Customizable array size (1-20 elements)

Solve Button:

Initiates the selected sorting algorithm

Provides a step-by-step visualization of the sorting process

*Visual Representation*

Each array element is represented as a bar, where the bar height corresponds to the element's value. The visualization uses color coding:

Blue: Default bar color

Red: Currently comparing/pivotal elements

Yellow: Elements being evaluated

Technical Implementation

*Frontend Technologies*

HTML5: Structured the application layout

CSS3: Styled the interface and created responsive design

JavaScript: Implemented sorting algorithms and interactive functionality

*Key JavaScript Components*

Array Generation: Randomly creates arrays of specified size

Sorting Algorithms: Implemented with async/await for smooth visualization

Rendering: Dynamic bar creation and updates

Interaction Handling: Button events and algorithm selection

*Learning Objectives*

Demonstrate different sorting algorithm approaches

Provide visual insight into sorting mechanisms

Help users understand algorithmic complexity

Improve understanding of data structure manipulation

*Algorithmic Complexity Showcase*

Bubble Sort: O(n²) - Simple but inefficient

Selection Sort: O(n²) - Slightly more efficient than bubble sort

Quick Sort: O(n log n) - Efficient for larger datasets

Merge Sort: O(n log n) - Stable and predictable performance

*Potential Improvements*

Add more sorting algorithms

Include speed control for visualization

*Implement step-by-step mode*

Add algorithmic complexity explanation

Create responsive design for mobile devices

*Educational Value*

This project serves as an excellent tool for:

Computer science students

*Coding learners*


Individuals interested in algorithm visualization
