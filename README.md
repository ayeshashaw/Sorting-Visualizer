### 1. Introduction

The Sorting Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to help users understand the workings of popular sorting algorithms. By providing a visual representation of the sorting process, this project simplifies the grasp of fundamental concepts in computer science and algorithm design. It serves as an ideal educational resource for students, coding enthusiasts, and anyone curious about how sorting algorithms function.

### 2. Algorithm Selection

Users can choose from four popular sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort

### 3. Interactive Controls

- **Generate New Array:** Allows users to create a new random array with a customizable size (1-20 elements).
  
- **Solve Button:** Initiates the selected sorting algorithm, providing a step-by-step visualization of the sorting process.

### 4. Visual Representation

Each array element is represented as a bar, with the bar height corresponding to the element's value. The visualization employs color coding:

- **Blue:** Default bar color
- **Red:** Currently comparing or pivotal elements
- **Yellow:** Elements being evaluated

### 5. Frontend Technologies

- **HTML5:** Used to structure the application layout.
- **CSS3:** Styled the interface and enabled responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** Implemented sorting algorithms and interactive functionality.

### 6. Key JavaScript Components

- **Array Generation:** Randomly creates arrays of the specified size.
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Implemented with async/await for smooth visualization.
- **Rendering:** Facilitates dynamic bar creation and updates.
- **Interaction Handling:** Manages button events and algorithm selection.

### 7. Learning Objectives

- Demonstrate various sorting algorithm techniques.
- Provide visual insight into sorting mechanisms.
- Help users understand algorithmic complexity.
- Improve understanding of data structure manipulation.

### 8. Algorithmic Complexity Showcase

- **Bubble Sort:** O(n²) - Simple but inefficient.
- **Selection Sort:** O(n²) - Slightly more efficient than Bubble Sort.
- **Quick Sort:** O(n log n) - Efficient for larger datasets.
- **Merge Sort:** O(n log n) - Stable and predictable performance.

### 9. Potential Improvements

- Add more sorting algorithms.
- Include a speed control feature for visualization.

### 10. Step-by-Step Mode

- Implement algorithmic complexity explanations.
- Create a responsive design for mobile devices.

### 11. Educational Value
